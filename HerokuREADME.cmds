Required:
1) Heroku needs to be installed (https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
2) You will need a Heroku account
3) Ping me after you make your heroku account so I can give you access to the giraffe-rss app 


Pushing to Heroku:
1) In  root run: heroku git:remote -a giraffe-rss
    This will allow the current directory to be pushed to heroku.
2) Try to push to heroku with the following command: git push heroku master
    Check below if there are any errors

Running locally:
1) In root run: foreman start
    This command should be installed with the toolbelt.
2) Currently the server is set to localhost:3000, check if it is running!

Errors:

1) Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP adress 'x.x.x.x' to the list of known hosts.
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exits:

1) Solution:
  First, try run: heroku keys:add
  if there is an option to add the: "id_rsa" key, select that option and repeat step 2 in "Pushing to Heroku".
  
  If this doesn't work, the source of the problem is if you don't have an id_rsa key. I resolved this with the following steps in git shell:
  
  1a) Change directory to: cd <Drive>:\Users\<User>\.ssh
  1b) Generate a new key: ssh-keygen -t rsa -C <your email>
  1c) You should be prompted for a name for the key you generated. Set the name to: id_rsa.pub
  1d) Set up a password if you wish, then run: ssh-add id_rsa 
      **Remember this password, you will need to use this password when you push. There are settings to get around it
      I haven't looked too much into them.
  
  After creating the key try to repeat step 2 in "Pushing to Heroku". Enter the password for the id_rsa.pub file if you placed one.
  Afterwards, If there nothing has been pulled, you should get an "Everything is up to date" message, else
  your changes wil be pushed to Heroku!
  
2) Warning:
